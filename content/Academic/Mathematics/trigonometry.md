# Trigonometry

## Overview

This document explores advanced trigonometric concepts such as sine, cosine, tangent, and their applications.

## Key Concepts

- Periodicity is a key concept in trigonometry, as trigonometric functions repeat their values at regular intervals.
- It can be found in various applications, such as physics, engineering, and astronomy.
- Wave functions and oscillations are often modeled using trigonometric functions.
